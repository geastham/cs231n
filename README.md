#CS231N - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
This is a working project repository for assignments / explorations associated with Stanford University's [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course. Please see the website for more information and project background.

I've chosen to implement this project using the Scala / Spark ecosystem with the following project dependencies:
  * Scala 2.10.0
  * ScalaTest 2.0.M5b (current ScalaTest 2.0 beta version)
  * ScalaNLP [Breeze](http://www.scalanlp.org/)
  * Apache Spark 1.4.2
  * SparkNet 1.2.0
  * Berkeley [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)

## Quick Setup

 1. Install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
 1. Clone this project
 1. Run `sbt` (This will also download all dependencies)
